This is the official repo of "The Challenge of Abnormal Behavior Detection in a Robotic Swarm" paper. 
The repo containes the code for the self-anomaly-detector (based on [MSCRED](https://github.com/7fantasysz/MSCRED)) and the coolaborative-anomaly detector.
To receive the swarm sensory data please contect us via email. To simulate new data using AirSim simulator please review our data generation [repo](https://github.com/harari-asaf/abnormal_behavior_detection_Simulations) .
